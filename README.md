At the heart of our mission is the commitment to leverage cutting-edge technology to enhance patient safety and care. We aim to develop a fall detection system using the M5 Stack MIC for an IoT Smart Hospital Bed. Our goal is to provide real-time, accurate, and reliable fall detection, thereby reducing response times, minimizing injuries, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. We believe in the power of technology to transform healthcare, and we are dedicated to creating a safer and more efficient environment for patients and healthcare providers alike.
